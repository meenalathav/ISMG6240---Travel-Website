1) Text color within the <section> area has been changed to a shade of blue. (color:#0E4D92;)

2) Header <h4> has been introduced with font size set to 90% of the default browser text size so it's smaller than the other headers and also text in uppercase to stand out from <p> area text.

3) Width of the <hgroup> element has been changed to 60% and the width of the <nav> element has been changed to account for the remaining 40% of the common parent <header> element.
