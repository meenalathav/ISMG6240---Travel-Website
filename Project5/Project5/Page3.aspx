                <h3>Tour of Italy</h3>
                <p>Bongiorno! It is everyone's dream to travel to Italy, to taste, experience and soak in all that the destination has to offer.  Whether you are heading to the beach or to the mountains, to the vineyards or to the historic cities, there are countless possibilities to create an exciting travel experience.  Your trip starts with a visit to the famous <span class="highlight">Colosseum </span>also known as the <span class="highlight">Flavian Amphitheatre</span>. Despite damage by fire, earthquake and pillaging of its stone for construction of palaces, the Colosseum still creates a powerful impression of its original form.</p>
                <p>We then take you to the <span class="highlight">2000-year-old Pantheon </span>.  This structure was built by Emperor Hadrian and it dates back to between <span class="highlight">118 and 125 AD </span>, making it one of the largest concrete structures in the world.</p>
                <p>Finally, your trip culminates with a trip to the mystical <span class="highlight">Trevi fountain</span> famed as a wishing fountain in the numerous movies it appears in. Why "Trevi"? The fountain  was built at the end point of the aqueduct, at the junction of three roads. These three streets or <span class="highlight">"tre view" (in Italian)</span> give the Trevi fountain its name: the <span class="highlight">Three Street Fountain</span>.  It was the money procured from the reintroduction of the lottery in Rome that sponsored the <span class="highlight">Trevi Fountain</span>!</p>

                <h3>Tour of Singapore</h3>
                <p>Visit Singapore to witness what advancement looks like, what modern means in today's era and most of all, what the future feels like.  We start our trip to Singapore with the visit to Singapore's awe-inspiring and award-winning <span class="highlight">Gardens by the Bay</span>. Get ready to tickle your visual sensory with 18 massive, tree shaped vertical gardens known as <span class="highlight">Supertrees</span>. Your trip to Gardens by the Bay is planned at night when the trees are beautifully lit up against the dark blanket of the night sky.</p>
                <p>Your stay in Singapore will be at the <span class="highlight">Marina Bay Hotel</span>.  It is known the world over for its Infinity pool, a pool on the hotel rooftop that appears to send <span class="highlight">400,000 gallons</span> of water off the edge of the roof in a stunning architectural design illusion. The hotel enchants not only with its SkyPark but also with its food menu and room service.  The quality and timeliness of the hotel's in-room service adheres to exceptionally strict standards and makes this resort an absolute top of the list in international hospitality and luxury.</p>
                <p>We then take you during the day to the <span class="highlight">Merlion</span>, the half-lion, half-fish statue.  Crowds of tourists all bustle to get a selfie with the famous structure.  The Fish's body of the Merlion represents Singapore's humble beginning as a small fishing village, while the Lion's head is derived from the country's original name, <span class="highlight">Singapura</span> meaning <span class="highlight">Lion City</span> in the Malay language.</p>

                <h3>Tour of London</h3>
                <p>All set for royalty? We're not talking so much about the British monarchy as we are about the treatment and pampering you'll be awarded with whilst travelling with us!</p>
                <p>Once in London, our first stop will be The Buckingham Palace where you can marvel at the <span class="highlight">Changing of the Guard</span> ceremony which is scheduled for a specific time and duration.  You don't have to worry about that, we'll make sure you arrive right in time to watch the spectacle. Then we show you the Houses of Parliament and <span class="highlight">Elizabeth Tower</span>, commonly called <span class="highlight">Big Ben</span>.  These are among London's most iconic attractions and must-see London tourist landmarks.  The name, Big Ben refers to the massive bell inside the clock tower, which weighs more than 13 tons.</p>
                <p>After the splendid first day, we will take a tour of <span class="highlight">Hyde Park</span>.  Hyde Park is the largest park in <span class="highlight">Central London </span>and the oldest park in the city.</p>
                <p>Finally, we will visit the <span class="highlight">London Eye</span>.  The London Eye, courtesy Coca-Cola is centrally located in the heart of the capital, over the River Thames opposite the Big Ben which grants a perfect vantage point of the city's landmarks and lights. It boasts more tourist footfalls than both the Taj Mahal and Pyramids of Giza combined!</p>

                <h3>Tour of Spain</h3>
                <p>Bull runs at Pamplona and the annual Tomatina festival are what pop to mind when one thinks of Spain. There is a whole lot more to this corner of Europe than the world reknown events of being chased by bulls and having a huge-scale street tomato fight!  We intend to open your eyes to the <span class="highlight">hidden gem</span> that is Spain, a treasure chest of natural wonders that like precious gems remain shielded from the world's spotlight.  This is a tour worth combining with your tour of Italy, if you so wish. </p>
                <p>Your tour of Spain begins in the West at the <span class="highlight">Costa de la Luz</span>, a Spanish name describing a section of the beaches of fine blond sand sweeping along the <span class="highlight">Andalusian coastline</span> of Cadiz and Huelva.  Keep your DSLRs charged and ready for stunning photo-ops of the seascape, with views of <span class="highlight">sand dunes</span> and pine forests stretching till the turquoise-blue waters of the Atlantic. Witness <span class="highlight">horse races</span> down the beach, something unique to Spain.  Try your hand at <span class="highlight">windsurfing</span>, take a dip in the crisp waters, or lie back on the sand listening to the waves and soaking in the sun.</p>
                <p>We then take you to <span class="highlight">Ibiza</span>, one of the islands composing the Spanish archipelago on the Mediterranean.  At Ibiza, expect to stay at a high-rise hotel surrounded by shopping and dining venues brightly lit in the night with bars and discos frequented by tourists for a vibrant nightlife.  During the day we take you to museums and galleries that were once seaside houses, shrines, castles, and even a <span class="highlight">monastery</span>.  Your tour ends at Spain's capital of Barcelona where you will explore the <span class="highlight">Barri Gòtic</span>, or Gothic Quarter, a medieval setting with old, <span class="highlight">cobblestone</span> streets lined with artisans selling their trades.</p>

                <h3>Tour of Japan</h3>
                <p>Kon'nichiwa! Here in Japan, a lot awaits you! We have you zipping from the city of Kyoto to Tokyo to Osaka.  There are guided <span class="highlight">bike tours</span> through the streets of both <span class="highlight">Kyoto</span> and Tokyo during the day.  You will pass by architectural landmarks and parks taking in everything from the street signs in foreign characters, local customs, local flora as you pedal along the roads and alleys.  In the nights, you will be guided through the <span class="highlight">shopping districts</span> with their vibrantly colored signs and large neon banners decorating store fronts.  You can buy Japanese attire such as the traditional kimono, <span class="highlight">Japanese fans and dolls</span> and even Japanese confectionary.</p>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Skytree tower</span> is part of your Tokyo tour.  Not only have we planned to take you to the top at <span class="highlight">450 meters</span> but you also have dinner to look forward to- at the <span class="highlight">Sky restaurant</span> perched a cool 345 meters above ground!  Though we make sure to feature as many events as possible there is one special feature at the Skytree that depends on your luck!  This is the <span class="highlight">Tokyo Aozora Soji</span> or "Cleaning the Blue Sky", a sight that the Skytree tower claims you have to be lucky to see.  This is the cleaning of the gallery windows at such dizzying heights that when you observe this from above, makes you feel the workers are "cleaning the sky".</p>
                <p>We wrap up your tour with <span class="highlight">Mt. Fuji</span>, which you have dazzling views of on your train ride from Tokyo to Osaka.  There are also stops to see <span class="highlight">Japanese gardens</span> complete with their Wisteria Arbors, <span class="highlight">Bonsai</span>, bamboo groves, moss covered statues and stone lanterns paired with water basins.  Of course, you will be delighted by the cherry blossoms also everywhere you travel!</p>
